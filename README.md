# HackingTools
  I own none of these projects. This is simply a collection of other peoples projects that I think are essentials to have on Kali Linux. These are just tools i think that are best for hacking with kali linux.  Install by writing "cd" than "git clone https://github.com/Eno123456/HackingTools" in your terminal. You can acsess these tools by typing "cd HackingTools". Than you can type "ls" to see all of the tools.
