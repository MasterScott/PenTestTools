# HackingTools
  I own none of these projects. This is simply a collection of other peoples projects that I think are essentials to have on Kali Linux. These are just tools i think that are best for pen-testing with kali linux.  Install by writing "git clone https://github.com/Eno123456/HackingTools" in your terminal. Than write "cd [/path/to/your/folder/]" than "python installer.py." It will automatically save the tools in you deskop. They all have reademe's from their creator.
